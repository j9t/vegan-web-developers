# Vegan Web Developers

⚠️ The vegan web developers list is available under [j9t.gitlab.io/vegan-web-developers](https://j9t.gitlab.io/vegan-web-developers/).

This is an overview of [vegan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veganism) web developers. Every vegan web developer may join: Add yourself directly [in the HTML](https://gitlab.com/j9t/vegan-web-developers/-/blob/master/index.html) and [submit a merge request](https://gitlab.com/j9t/vegan-web-developers/-/merge_requests/new). But as you’re here on GitHub, you can also ask to be added by [filing an issue](https://github.com/j9t/vegan-web-developers/issues/new/choose).
